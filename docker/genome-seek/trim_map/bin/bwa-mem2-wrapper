# About: this script is a wrapper around bwa-mem2
# that selects the correct Intel compiled binary
# based on the CPU architecture of the host machine.
# This is necessary because the Intel compiled binary
# AVX-512 binary is NOT compatible with Zen4 AMD CPUs.
# AVX-512 support was added in Zen4 and is not present
# in Zen3. On Biowulf, the new AMD nodes are Zen4. If
# a AMD node is detected, this script will use the
# an AVX2 compiled binary instead, if left to bwa-mem2
# it will select the axv-512bw binary and error out.
# The difference in performance is minimal between
# AVX-512 vs. AVX2 (may be around 20-30% faster), so
# it's not a big deal to use the AVX2 binary on Zen4.
